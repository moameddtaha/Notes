# ZAProxy

---

- The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by a dedicated international team of volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. It's also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing. -  [GITHUB](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) | [The ZAP Homepage](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
