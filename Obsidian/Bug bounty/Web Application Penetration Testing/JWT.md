# JWT

---

JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.

# JWT Toolkit

---

This tool is written for **pentesters**, who need to check the strength of the tokens in use, and their susceptibility to known attacks. A range of tampering, signing and verifying options are available to help delve deeper into the potential weaknesses present in some JWT libraries.

It has also been successful for **CTF challengers** - as CTFs seem keen on JWTs at present. It may also be useful for **developers** who are using JWTs in projects, but would like to test for stability and for known vulnerabilities when using forged tokens. - [GitHub](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool)

> _jwt_tool.py_ is a toolkit for validating, forging, scanning and tampering JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).
