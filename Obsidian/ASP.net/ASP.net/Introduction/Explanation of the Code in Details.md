# Explanation of the Code in Details

```CSharp
namespace MyFirstApp
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
            var app = builder.Build();

            app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

1. **var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);**
    
    - **Purpose**: Initializes a new instance of the `WebApplicationBuilder` class.
        
    - **Details**:
        
        - `**WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)**`:
            
            - `CreateBuilder` is a static method that initializes a `WebApplicationBuilder` instance.
                
            - `args` represents command-line arguments passed to the application.
                
            - The builder sets up the default configuration, logging, and dependency injection (DI) services.
                
        - **Configuration**:
            
            - Reads configuration settings from various sources (e.g., appsettings.json, environment variables).
                
        - **Logging**:
            
            - Configures default logging services.
                
        - **Dependency Injection**:
            
            - Registers services to be used by the application via DI.
                
                  
                
2. **var app = builder.Build();**
    
    - **Purpose**: Builds the `WebApplication` instance.
        
    - **Details**:
        
        - `**builder.Build()**`:
            
            - Finalizes the app's configuration and prepares it for running.
                
            - Compiles all middleware components added during the build process.
                
            - Creates the `WebApplication` object that will handle HTTP requests.
                
                  
                
3. **app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");**
    
    - **Purpose**: Sets up a route that maps HTTP GET requests to a specific path (in this case, the root URL).
        
    - **Details**:
        
        - `**app.MapGet**`:
            
            - A convenience method to define a route that matches GET requests.
                
            - `"/"` specifies the root URL path.
                
            - `() => "Hello World!"` is a lambda expression that defines the response to be returned when the route is accessed.
                
            - The lambda returns a plain string "Hello World!" which is sent as the HTTP response body.
                
                  
                
4. **app.Run();**
    
    - **Purpose**: Runs the application.
        
    - **Details**:
        
        - `**app.Run()**`:
            
            - Starts the Kestrel web server (or the configured server) and begins listening for incoming HTTP requests.
                
            - This is a blocking call that keeps the application running until it is manually stopped (e.g., via Ctrl+C in the console).
                
            - The application is now live and will respond to requests based on the configured routes and middleware.
                

## Summary

- The code creates and configures a minimal ASP.NET Core web application.
    
- `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` sets up the application with default settings.
    
- `builder.Build()` finalizes the configuration and prepares the application.
    
- `app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!")` maps a GET request to the root URL and returns "Hello World!" as a response.
    
- `app.Run()` starts the web server and runs the application, ready to handle incoming requests.
