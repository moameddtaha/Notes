# Resize

> [!info]
> You have the flexibility to dynamically adjust the size of the array. When increasing the size, new elements will be automatically set to their default values. Conversely, when reducing the size, any extra elements beyond the specified size will be removed.

***In case of increasing the array:***

1. Initialize a new array.
2. Copy all existing elements into the new array, setting the new added elements to their default values (zero for integers, null for strings, etc.).
